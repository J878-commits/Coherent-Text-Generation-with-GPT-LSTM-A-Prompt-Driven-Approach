🧠 Coherent Text Generation with GPT/LSTM: A Prompt-Driven Approach
Internship Task 4 – CodTech IT Solutions 

📌 Project Overview
As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I developed a modular text generation system using GPT and LSTM architectures. The goal was to create a prompt-driven engine capable of generating coherent, context-aware paragraphs on specific topics—particularly in civic domains such as urban safety, financial fraud, and public trust.

🏗️ Model Architecture
🔹 LSTM-Based Generator
Implemented a sequential model with Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers

Trained on curated civic and general-purpose datasets

Integrated tokenization, padding, and safe token lookup to ensure robust generation

🔹 GPT-Based Generator
Leveraged pre-trained transformer models (e.g., GPT-2/GPT-Neo)

Applied prompt engineering for domain-specific outputs

Enabled multilingual generation with minimal fine-tuning

🧩 Key Features
Prompt-Driven Generation: Accepts user-defined seed text and generates coherent paragraphs

Multilingual Support: Generates narratives in English, Malayalam, and Hindi

Theme Injection: Adapts output based on civic topics like urban safety or housing violations

Error-Resilient Design: Handles token lookup failures gracefully to maintain output quality

Interactive Notebook: Includes modular functions and optional Gradio UI for real-time demos

💡 Insights & Learnings
Model Selection: GPT models offer superior contextual fluency, while LSTM models require careful training and token management

Prompt Engineering: Seed text quality directly impacts coherence and relevance

Localization: Multilingual capabilities enhance inclusivity and user engagement

Scalability: The modular design supports future extensions like summarization, style transfer, and civic alert simulation

✅ Outcome
Delivered a fully functional notebook demonstrating coherent text generation from user prompts

Enabled multilingual, theme-aware outputs suitable for civic tech applications

Built a foundation for productization and integration into outreach platforms

Contributed to CodTech’s innovation in AI-driven storytelling and user-centric design

🏁 Conclusion
This project showcases how generative AI can transform minimal input into meaningful, localized narratives. By combining technical precision with civic relevance, the solution aligns with CodTech IT Solutions’ mission to build intelligent, inclusive digital tools. The Task 4 deliverable is not just a model—it’s a scalable storytelling engine ready for real-world impact.
